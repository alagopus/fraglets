YAELP - Yet Another Everquest Logfile Parser

This program is geared towards guild roster
maintenance. It extracts who lines from log files and
collects them in a table.

There are several filter options and export methods.
The most useful output is probably the HTML output,
ready to be pasted into a web site or even an ezboard
message (if the forum allows HTML). Configurable
filters and styles to adapt to your roster preferences
and web page layout.

Main class: RosterFrame
Invocation: With Sun JRE 1.2 or higher installed, double-click the yaelp.jar file.
Required libraries: sax.jar, xp.jar, xt.jar

Example output:
