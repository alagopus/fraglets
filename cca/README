CruiseControl add-on (plugin) enabling use of the CVS history file for
modification detection. Using this is much faster and the history file
can be pulled via HTTP, enabling builds from viewcvs tarballs.

Add the following line to your <project .../>:

	<plugin name="cvshistory" classname="net.sf.fraglets.cca.CVSHistory"/>
	
And use the plugin in the <modificationset .../>:

	<cvshistory historyfilename="checkout/cvshistory/history"/>

You can pull the history from CVS in a separate project and make your
project dependent on it using the buildstatus modification set.
