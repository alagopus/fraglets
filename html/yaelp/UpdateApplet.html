it from <A href="http://java.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</A>. If you get lost on
that site, seek J2SE, Downloads, a recent version (1.4.1 for instance) and use
the JRE column on the <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">download
page.</A> Check <A href="../wiz/UpdateApplet.png">this screenshot</A> to check
that it works as intended.

You will be asked to trust this applet. That is because this applet needs file
access to your local computer to read log files and requires an existing
EverQuest(TM) installation. See <A href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com">the
official EverQuest site</A> for more information about everquest.

You can use this applet as an application as well, just download
wizard-xxx.jar from the
<A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5068">project
download page</A>. Double-clicking on the wizard-xxx.jar
should open a window if you have a recent Java runtime engine installed.
