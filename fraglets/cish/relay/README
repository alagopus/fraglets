This is a crude inetd replacement. The design is quite crude and
minimalistic. Few effort is done towards portability or
configurability. If you need a more able program, look for a free and
complete inetd distribution.

Start building by invoking ./configure. This is GNU configure created
by autoconf. Don't expect too much from this configuration, since the
inetd.c and relay.c don't make overall use of the facts that are
detected by configure.

Next, run make. If that does not succeed, you probably should
abandon this package.

Configuration for inetd is found in inetd.cnf. The format is explained
in the example supplied with the sources.

Configuration for the relay program is found in relay.cnf, which is
searched in the current directory where the relay runs, which in turn
is inherited from the inetd program when an incoming connection is
accepted. That file contains exactly two words, separated by whitespace
(space, tab newline or carriage return). The first word is the host
name to connect, the second is the port number in decimal.

WARNING: NEVER configure the relay program to connect your inetd.
Apart from not leading to the desired result, it will most likely lock
up the machine you are using, eating up all internet resources quickly.
Please be aware that both inetd and relay provided here are quite
minimal programs, running fast.  Don't expect to be able to interrupt
it any more, once you looped relay to inetd. If you are lucky, the last
sensible response will be you shell's prompt. If you are very lucky,
the machine is not locked up completely.
