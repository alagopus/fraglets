<a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/">Everquest</a><a href="#EverQuest_trademark">®</a> Log file Parser &#8211; YAELP</h1>





<h2>Overview</h2>





YAELP is an EverQuest<a href="#EverQuest_trademark">®</a> log file parser
designed to create and maintain one or more guild rosters. There are some
functions which deal with attributes of your personal characters, but these
are limited to skill attributes. If you need more detail and statistics on
your own characters, you should look for one of <a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=everquest+parser">the other parsers out there</a>.<br>





<br>





A globally universal and compact <a href="#YAELP_Save_file_format">save file format</a> allows you to <a href="#Sharing_roster_information">share character roster information</a> 
with other players through email. Roster information for 300+ characters
takes less than 10k of save file size. The same roster, stripped of all extra 
information and properties and exported in CSV text format takes up more
than twice the space.<br>





<br>

You will need a recent version of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">Java&#8482; virtual machine</a>
to run this program. If you do not plan to develop and just want to run the
program choose a download from the JRE column for your platform. Some operating
systems already come with Java&#8482; preinstalled. Try running <code>java -version</code>
from a command line. If it does not report an error and the version printed
is 1.3.x or above, you should be fine and won't need to download it.<br>

<br>





<a href="http://sourceforge.net/"><img src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=5068&amp;type=1" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 88px; height: 31px;" align="right" alt="Hosted by SourceForge" hspace="8" vspace="8"></a>Development is currently done as a part of the <a href="http://fraglets.sourceforge.net/">fraglets project</a> at <a href="http://sourceforge.com/">sourceforge</a>. You can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5068">download the latest release</a> from the files section. Open bugs are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5068&amp;atid=105068">tracked here</a>, please submit any new bugs you might happen to find. YAELP is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>
which allows you to copy and modify it as long as you keep the license and
copyright intact and put the results under the same license.<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Unpack the <code>yaelp-<span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">XX</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.zip</code>
archive to an empty directory of your choice. There is no installer and no
configuration to be done other than unpacking it. Just remember where you
put it.<br>
<h2>Starting the program</h2>
This is something I have not cared for much yet. Procedures vary depending
on operation system and configuration. If your platform supports it, you
may start the program by double-clicking the <code>yaelp-<span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">XX</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.jar</code> file. This is an executable jar file which contains the main program code.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't work for you, start a command line interface and change to the directory where you unpacked the archive. Type <code>java -jar yaelp-<span style="font-style: italic;">X</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">XX</span>.jar</code> to start the program. You may have to provide the full path to the java executable if it is not in your current execution path.<br>
<br>
After program initialization a window looking similar like this should open:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="yaelp_start.png" alt="Starting YAELP" style="width: 467px; height: 224px;" align="top">
<br>
</div>





<h2>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">File</span> menu.</h2>





<p><img src="File_menu.png" alt="Figure 1: The File menu" style="width: 156px; height: 240px;" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8">
This is where you will almost always start working. If you have
previouosly used YAELP and saved some of the results, you might want
to <u><a name="Load_"></a>Load ...</u>
these now. This will restore all entries which were visible in the character
roster at the time they were saved. Loading a new roster will clear all current
entries. You may be asked for confirmation if the program detects that unsaved
changes exist.</p>




<p><img style="border: 0px solid ; height: 59px; width: 313px;" alt="Status line with all entries hidden" src="all_hidden.png" align="right" ismap="">
The current <a href="#The_Filter_menu">filter settings</a> remain active
when loading new data. Filter settings are not stored in the save file. So
if you don't see what you expected, have a look at the status line at the
bottom of the window. If  there are many characters hidden just clear the
filter settings.<br>

</p>











<p>Now you may want <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Parse_logs_"></a>Parse logs ...</span>
to update the roster with new information from the latest log files. YAELP
can parse the plain text log files (eqlog_*.txt) as well as gzip compressed
log files (eqlog_*.txt.gz). Information in the roster is updated according to the <a href="#Timestamps_and_roster_updating">timestamp mechanism</a>. This allows you to parse a bunch of intermixed log files which may be in any order.<br>
</p>






<p>Since the time recorded in the log files is the local time according to your time zone, you should <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>parse log files you got from a different time zone. Dont exchange raw log files, better exchange the saved roster information.<br>
</p>





<p> To keep things accurate, make sure your system clock is set correctly.
This can be automatically done using a network time client like <a href="http://nettime.sourceforge.net/">NetTime</a>. Note that you may have to watch out that this does not constantly open your dialup connection. See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=10109&amp;atid=210109">support forum for NetTime</a> if it causes you trouble.<br>
</p>










<p><img src="Parse_logs.png" alt="Figure 2: Parse log files" style="width: 220px; height: 197px;" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8">
 The file chooser for parsing tries to find your Everquest<a href="#EverQuest_trademark">®</a> install directory when opened the fist time. Since the average Everquest<a href="file:///C:/home/kre/fraglets/fraglets/html/yaelp/userman.html#EverQuest_trademark">®</a> directory
contains well over a thousand files, the file filter is initialized such
that only log files should be visible. If you renamed your log files so that
they don't show up here, change the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Files of type:</span> setting to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All Files</span> in the file chooser.<br>
</p>










<p>Scanning this directory takes some time since it contains so many files.
Don't panic if no files show up for the first few seconds. Specifically with
Java versions 1.4 there is no visual indication that it is still busy searching
files; it is working in the background.<br>
</p>


<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Save_"></a>Save ...</span> saves the currently visible portion of the roster into a <a href="#YAELP_Save_file_format">YAELP format save file</a>. Note that this means that all characters excluded from the table <span style="font-style: italic;">are not included</span> in the information saved. So be sure to <a href="#The_Filter_menu">disable all filters</a> if you want to save all information loaded.<br>
</p>










<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Import_"></a>Import ...</span> loads some previously saved YAELP roster and adds the information to the current roster.

It uses the same <a href="#Timestamps_and_roster_updating">timestamp mechanism</a>
as the log file parser. However, timestamps in <a href="#YAELP_Save_file_format">YAELP save files</a>
are timezone independent so that you can exchange these file with other people.
Loading automatically detects if the file is compressed, so you can load
exported XML as well.<br>





<br>





<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Export_table_"></a>Export table ...</span> stores the current table contents as a <a href="#CSV_file_format">comma separated text file</a>.
This may be used later to import into a spreadsheet or further manipulate
the information with other software. This format contains much less information
so you cannot load it again.<br>



<br>



<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Export_XML_"></a>Export XML ...</span> saves all roster information in an uncompressed XML file. This is the same as using <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save ...</span>,
but without the compression step. Since this is the XML input which will
be passed to the XSL transformation when creating HTML this option is useful
when creating new style sheets to examine the XML for things to match on.<br>



<br>



<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="Export_HTML_"></a>Export HTML ...</span> transforms the current roster list with column and sorting settings into a HTML file using the <a href="#The_Style_menu">selected XSL style</a>.
Depending on the style used, this creates a complete HTML page for use in
your web site, or a fragment to post on forums. Or even a different XML format
you may need for another program. In that sense, the menu entry is a bit
of a misnomer, but it reflects the most common usage. This is what the test data from the <a href="#YAELP_Save_file_format">save file section</a> looks when exported with one of the predefined styles:<br>


<br>



<table style="width: 80%; background-color: rgb(153,51,0); vertical-align: middle; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2">


<tbody><tr style="background-color: rgb(204,153,102); color: rgb(245,245,220);"><td class="headings"><b>Name</b></td><td class="headings"><b>Culture</b></td><td class="headings"><b>Class</b></td><td class="headings"><b>Level</b></td><td class="headings"><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr style="background-color: rgb(227,190,140);"><td class="m">Testator </td><td class="m">Testling </td><td class="m">Tester </td><td class="m">6 </td><td class="m">2002-07-13 </td></tr></tbody>
</table>




<br>


Note that the style used here omits the Guild column, which makes sense when all characters listed are in the same guild anyway.

<h2><a name="Sharing_roster_information"></a>Sharing roster information</h2>





<a href="#Import_">Importing YAELP save files</a> from other players will
be the easiest way to share character roster information. For instance, have
your officers send you filtered updates on the guild roster in YAELP file
format from their log files and combine them to create a fairly complete
guild roster. Since officers are the persons who invite others to the guild,
their log files will probably show all the members joining the guild. You
should get a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rank</span> property
on all guild members who are seen joining the guild, with the timestamp on
that property the last time of joining the guild or being promoted.<br clear="all">

some text explaining timestamps<br>





<h2><a name="YAELP_Save_file_format"></a>YAELP Save file format</h2>





YAELP save files get a file name extension of <code style="font-weight: bold;">.yxr</code>
by default. YXR is an abbreviation for YAELP XML Roster. And that is exactly
what it is: an XML representation of the roster information, <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">GZIP</a> compressed. If you have the gzip program, you can look at it using <code>gzip -dc myroster.yxr</code> for instance.<br>





<br>





Here is a short example of the (uncompressed) XML file contents:<br>





<blockquote>
  <pre><small>&lt;<span class="start-tag">roster</span><span class="attribute-name"> title</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"Roster"</span>&gt;<br> &lt;<span class="start-tag">heading</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"name"</span>&gt;Name&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"culture"</span>&gt;Culture&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"class"</span>&gt;Class&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"level"</span>&gt;Level&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"guild"</span>&gt;Guild&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"zone"</span>&gt;Zone&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">column</span><span class="attribute-name"> id</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"time"</span>&gt;Time&lt;/<span class="end-tag">column</span>&gt;<br> &lt;/<span class="end-tag">heading</span>&gt;<br> &lt;<span class="start-tag">avatar</span><span class="attribute-name"> time</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"1026571151670"</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">name</span>&gt;Testator&lt;/<span class="end-tag">name</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">culture</span>&gt;Testling&lt;/<span class="end-tag">culture</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">class</span>&gt;Tester&lt;/<span class="end-tag">class</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">level</span>&gt;6&lt;/<span class="end-tag">level</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">guild</span><span class="attribute-name"> time</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"1026571218560"</span>&gt;The Testing Testers&lt;/<span class="end-tag">guild</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">zone</span>&gt;void&lt;/<span class="end-tag">zone</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">time</span>&gt;2002-07-13&lt;/<span class="end-tag">time</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="start-tag">property</span><span class="attribute-name"> name</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"Rank" </span><span class="attribute-name">value</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"a regular member" </span><span class="attribute-name">time</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"1026571243120"</span><span class="attribute-name">/</span>&gt;<br> &lt;/<span class="end-tag">avatar</span>&gt;<br>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">roster</span>&gt;</small><br></pre>
</blockquote>





This example contains information for only one character named Testator. For each successive character, the <code>avatar</code> section will repeated. Most tags in the avatar section should be self-explanatory. The <code>time</code>
attributes store the timestamp of the last change in milliseconds since midnight,
January 1, 1970 UTC. There are three things which get a timestamp: the avatar
section as a whole, the guild and each property. These are explained in detail
in the <a href="#Timestamps_and_roster_updating">timestamps and roster updating</a> section. The extra <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag is redundant and only retained for HTML formatting. It contains the avatar time truncated to a date, in ISO format.<br>





<br>





The <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code> section is currently only used in styles
for HTML output and ignored when loading the file. The column id attributes
map to the avatar sub-tags, assigning a table header name to each tag. They
are listed in column order, as well as the tags in the avatar sections. Predefined
XSL styles make use of that fact so that the transformation becomes much
simpler and faster.<br>





<h2><a name="CSV_file_format"></a>CSV file format</h2>





Here is an example of a CSV export:<br>





<blockquote>
  <pre><small>"Name", "Culture", "Class", "Level", "Guild", "Zone", "Time"<br>"Testator", "Testling", "Tester", "6", "The Testing Testers", "void", "2002-07-13"</small><br></pre>
</blockquote>





<img src="CSV_import.png" alt="Importing CSV to OpenOffice Calc" style="width: 327px; height: 118px;" align="right">





This is the same example as in the <a href="#YAELP_Save_file_format">save file format section</a>. However, since only information from the table is exported, all timestamp and property information is lost.<br>





<br>





If you want to import this into <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>
Calc or some other spreadsheet application, use double quote as text delimiter
and comma and space as a field delimiter and combine delimiters. This should
import the table nice and clean. Note that the screen shot shows the german
version so your options may be named differently.<br clear="all">
